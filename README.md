# ALAB-308A.3.1-Promises-AsynS


I have alot of commented out session because i was getting alot of error. I have to move from codesandbox to vcs IDE because.

Dearest Instructor, 
please we need more demo for this promise and asyn to grasp fully on it works.. Because if you find error in my code. Just accept it that way.  

line 51: says I cant use await() to access my central database so I am leeaving it this way. 
I tried defining the database from fetchUserData fuction before return my new promise but it wasnt working..: //defining dbs
    // const dbs = {
    //     db1: db1,
    //     db2: db2,
    //     db3: db3,
    //   };
